# What is HTML?

Hyper Text Markup Language

Invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee

# How do I get stuff to show up on a web page?

Wrap your content in HTML tags!

# What is an element? Is that the same as a tag?

An element is the browser's interpretation of an HTML tag.

The tag is just the plain text in your HTML file.
The element is basically a variable that the browser defines for itself.

# What is CSS?

Cascading
Style
Sheets

It's how you write code to customize how a browser draws elements to the page.

## How do I associate a CSS file with an HTML file?

Use a `<link>` tag!

# What is specificity in terms of selectors?

The styles of a more specific selector take precedence over the less specific selector, when both selectors match the same element on the page.

## When might I use an id selector?

You want to keep all the styles from the element and/or the class names, but you want to override a few specific styles for that one single element, but you want to avoid using !important.

# What is the box model?

"The Property Analogy"

Content - House
Padding - Yard
Border  - Fence
Margin  - the space between your fence and anything else


It's how the browser knows how big to draw your content and its whitespace on the page.
